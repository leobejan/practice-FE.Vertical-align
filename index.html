    <h1>3 (for now) ways to vertically align / html&css</h1>
    <p>
      1. with line-height:
      <a href="./vertical-align-v01-line-height.html" target="_blank"
        >with line-height</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      2. with position si transform:translate:
      <a href="./vertical-align-v02-position&transform.html" target="_blank"
        >with position & transform:translate :)</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      3. with flex:
      <a href="./vertical-align-v03-flex.html" target="_blank">With Flex</a>
    </p>
    <em
      >Note: the menu (main container) is created with grid, the alignments
      applied to childs (items)</em
    >
    <h2>
      This is the main page who link's to some example/practice for vertical
      alignment of content
    </h2>
    <p>
      Were done mostly for myself while learning and practice but anyone who
      read it can learn something.
    </p>
    <p>
      As readers can see, the most effective way to place & align the content is
      with flex.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have made these examples to show the differences and struggles compared
      between them and observe which one is quicker and less code
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, there can be other methods too (I am still on learning process
      at the time of writing) :)
